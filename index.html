    <p><i>I've been described as a lightning bolt to work with (I choose to take that as a compliment and not that I cause destruction and mayhem). 
        If you've worked with me, you know I'm not shy about speaking up and its always for the better of the project. 
       I’m passionate about people in all capacities from consumers and communities to colleagues and I bring that perspective with me to every project. 
For what I lack in years of experience, I balance with ambition and eagerness. 
        Even with the most difficult constraints, I enjoy building out smart and efficient solutions that challenge the status quo and leave you thinking "Why didn't I think of that?" </i>

        <h2>Brigham Health Hub</h2>
        <p>Brigham affectionately known as my “baby” was the first project I was thrust on to since working in Hill Holliday. Brigham, a locally recognizable and loved hospital, was transforming into a national brand – Brigham Health. Set to compete with brands such as Mayo Clinic. A large departure from the highly technical aspect of what I’d previously worked on, it was a perfect mix of consumer centricity and trending tech capabilities. What started off as a content strategy, morphed into a personalization and test and learn strategy encompassing site, email, and social development. And the results paid off, with an increase in Avg Page views, TOS, Email opens and CTR, they’re well on their way to a national threat.

          <h2> Boston Healthcare for the Homeless</h2>
          <p>While I enjoy kicking ass at my day job, I have a special place in my heart for community organizations that provide support to those in need. In comes my digital work with Boston Healthcare for the Homeless for the Sox for Socks and SPOT program</p>

        <h2>New Biz </h2>
        <p>The pleasure of working at an agency is found within the diversity of clients. As a young passionate ____, I’m pulled into a variety of projects ranging from retail to pharma clients. Bringing my innovative thought process to each unique problem of my clients, my environment serves as a welcomed exercise in creative thinking, pushing boundaries along the way.
