                <p>
                    Believe it or not, UConn is actually known for something other than an
                    <strike>UNSTOPPABLE</strike> basketball team. Our school is ranked in the <em>top 20</em> of Public Universities.
                    I've had the pleasure of being a student in the <strong>College Liberal Arts and Sciences</strong> which
                    has broadened my perspective and taught me how to attack any problem.

                    <h3>Best Classes</h3>

                    <h2>Global Marketing Strategy & Intro to Marketing:</h2>
                    <p>These classes taught me about the principals of marketing. You know the <strong> 4 p's, 3 c's and the rest of the alphabet.</strong>                        I learned the importance of the consumer and the power of branding. These classes sparked my interest
                        in the discipline.

                    <p>
                        The fact that you're viewing my resume on a website is proof that the digital platform is <i>kind of</i>                        a <strong>big deal</strong>. So, I thought it would be pretty important to understand how people
                        communicate in a digital world.

                    <p> A few old favorites here. These 3 classes gave me a snapshot into the world of Advertising and Public
                        Relations. In both of these classes I completed group assignments that mimicked projects done in
                        agencies.

            <h2>Aetna |Consumer Health and Services Leadership Develoment Program </h2>
            <p>
                The basic premise of the program was to throw us into projects at
                <stong>full-speed</strong> and see how we managed. So, I had the pleasure of <b>leading</b> up a few projects for
                    Aetna. </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In my traditional marketing rotation, I translated our overarching campaign into our event assets and activations.
                With such a small team, I had to use everything I knew to figure it out. As for what I didn't know, I had
                to lean on my <strong>relationships</strong> to help fill in the gaps. </p>
            <br>
            <p> 
                My second rotation solidified my interest in the digital landscape. While working for the digital team, I married
                my strong communications theory background with my passion for digital and honed in on what our members actually
                wanted. I did research on what apps aligned with our goals/vision for the company. In addition, I developed
                a strategy to improve our user experiences on our digital assets. </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                All in all, the rotational progam pushed me, developed me, and I'm ready to take on my next challenge.

            <h2>Cronin and Company | Account Services Intern </h2>
            <p>
                My role as an intern is hard to put in a few bullet points because it encompassed so much. Here’s my best attempt:
                <br> As an intern I provide general support for the agency’s largest account, Amica Insurance, and assisted
                account team with projects for television, online and development of multicultural marketing initiative.
                In addition, I conducted <strong>research</strong> on Client competitors and <strong>consumer behavior</strong>                to gain insights on trends and <strong>advertising and positioning strategies </strong>for brands such as
                Montefiore Medical Center and Connecticut Children’s Hospital. Also, I identify <strong>social media trends</strong>                amongst competitors and present findings to account service team.

        <h2>Susan Gunter | Project Manager - Consumer Business Marketing, Aetna</h2>
        <p>
            Saige has been an absolute pleasure to work with. She is very mature for her age and I like that she isn’t afraid
            to be proactive when answers aren’t always as apparent or if she feels something isn’t going right. She also
            seems to stay calm under pressure and in a place where we are living with constant ambiguity this is extremely
            important.
